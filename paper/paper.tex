\section{General Information}

The bat algorithm was introduced...

Many populational optimization algorithms can benefit from paralization. This work attemps to investigate the 
applicability of GPU parallization on the bat algorithm.


In this work the bath algorithm used was the one proposed by (parpinelli reference).

It was developed two versions of the algorithm. One that runs on CPU and the other which uses CPU.


The benchmark functions used were the following:

ROSENBROOK, SPHERE, SCHWEFEL, ACKLEY, RASTRINGIN, GRIEWANK, SHUBER

For the GPU version the approach used was the split of each individual in one thread.
It was observed speedups with big populations.


\section{Experiment}

Experiment 1

Function: Griewank
Bats: 256
Iterations: 10000


Experiment 2

Function: Griewank
Bats: 768
Iterations: 10000



\section{Results}


\subsection{Device details}

The experiments were executed on a machine with the following configuration:

Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4460  CPU @ 3.20GHz

GK208 GeForce GT 720 1024 MB of vram
\subsection{E1}

1m4.888s
0m55.439s
Speedup: 1.16x


\subsection{E2}

2m27.902s
0m21.976s
Speedup: 7x

\section{Conclusion}

With this work it's clear that is possible to speedup the bat methaueristic using GPU but
the best results are only achieved by a great population size.

\section{Further works}

It may be explored the usage of blocks as representation for the dimensions in which each bat deals.
